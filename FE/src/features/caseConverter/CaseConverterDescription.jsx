      <h1>Text Case Styles</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Lower Case</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> In lowercase, all letters are written in their smallest form (e.g., a, b, c).</p>
        <p><strong>Usage:</strong> It is commonly used in informal writing or when typing casually. Some programming languages also rely heavily on lowercase. In many cases, lowercase is used for emphasis or to indicate less importance compared to uppercase.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> hello world</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Upper Case</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Uppercase refers to text where all the letters are in their capital form (e.g., A, B, C).</p>
        <p><strong>Usage:</strong> This is typically used for emphasis, in titles, acronyms, or for yelling in digital communication. Uppercase letters make text stand out more, and they can be seen as visually "stronger" or more commanding.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> HELLO WORLD</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Sentence Case</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> In sentence case, only the first letter of the first word is capitalized, and the rest of the words are in lowercase, except for proper nouns (names, places, etc.).</p>
        <p><strong>Usage:</strong> This is the standard format for writing sentences in English and many other languages. Itâ€™s used in most regular writing, such as in paragraphs, emails, and general text.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Hello world, how are you today?</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Title Case/Capitalize Case</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> In title case, most words in the title or heading are capitalized. Typically, articles (a, an, the), conjunctions (and, but, or), and prepositions (in, on, at) are left in lowercase unless they appear at the beginning or end of the title. The first and last words are always capitalized, regardless of their type.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Title case is generally used for book titles, headlines, or names of articles and other works. It makes the text more eye-catching and formal.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Alternating Case</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Alternating case involves changing the case of each letter in a sequence, typically alternating between uppercase and lowercase. For example, the first letter is uppercase, the second is lowercase, and so on.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage:</strong> This style is often used to grab attention or for playful, informal writing. It's sometimes used on social media or in memes for emphasis, humor, or just to make text stand out.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> HeLlO wOrLD</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Inverse Case (or Reverse Case)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> In inverse case, each letter's case is swapped. For example, uppercase letters become lowercase, and lowercase letters become uppercase.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage:</strong> This style can be used for emphasis, to make text appear visually distinct, or as a creative stylistic choice in some informal contexts.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> hELLO wORLD</p>
      </section>
    </div>
